For each ship:
  Have a grid that keeps track of what squares it has guessed and a counter representing the number of squares left to guess (100)

  Pick random x,y from 1..10
    If square is taken, mark in grid, decrement counter, and keep looking
    If square is available
      Randomly select 1..4 (left, right, up, down)
      Attempt to place self in that direction
        If can't, mark first square that is already taken, decrement counter, and randomly pick from remaining directions, and repeat
          If all four options are blocked, mark square as effectively taken, decrement counter and start back at line 2
        If can place self, write to board and break
    If no valid placements are found (the counter reaches 0), raise an error
